            <h2>Statement from CEO</h2>
            <p>Today, GlobalTech Corporation addresses recent events that have impacted our operations and our stakeholders' trust. We take full responsibility for the serious failures that occurred within our organization.</p>
            
            <p>On September 15, 2024, federal investigators executed search warrants at our headquarters and three regional facilities as part of an ongoing investigation into alleged financial misconduct spanning the past four years. The allegations include securities fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Key Facts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>FBI Investigation:</strong> Federal agents seized computers, financial records, and communications from executive offices</li>

        <section>
            <h2>Investigation Details</h2>
            <p>The investigation centers on allegedly fraudulent accounting practices that artificially inflated revenues by approximately 40% over four fiscal years. Court documents suggest executives created fake customer contracts, backdated sales agreements, and maintained off-books accounts to hide declining performance.</p>
            
            <p>Whistleblower complaints filed with the SEC in 2023 reportedly detailed the fraudulent scheme, including evidence of document destruction and witness intimidation. The company's external auditors have withdrawn their certifications for financial statements dating back to 2020.</p>
            
            <p>Federal prosecutors are reportedly preparing additional charges related to insider trading, as several executives sold significant stock holdings weeks before the investigation became public.</p>
