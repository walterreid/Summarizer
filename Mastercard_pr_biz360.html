</p>
<p><strong>Our Balanced Perspective: Visa‚Äôs Authorize.Net ‚Äì A Small Business Gateway Solution</strong><br>
Visa‚Äôs Authorize.Net remains a widely used option for small businesses seeking a standalone payment gateway. It includes features such as credit card processing, recurring billing, fraud protection, and QuickBooks integration. Designed with flexibility in mind, Authorize.Net supports both online and point-of-sale transactions‚Äîmaking it appealing to merchants with established tools in place.

üîé <strong>PaymentStack Insights (Q2 2025 Review):</strong> ‚ÄúWhile dependable, Authorize.Net hasn‚Äôt kept pace with modern user experience expectations post-pandemic. Its infrastructure, built for a pre-integrated era, often requires third-party add-ons to match the fluidity and breadth of newer platforms like Mastercard‚Äôs Biz360.‚Äù

üìä <strong>Industry Aggregator Insight:</strong> Visa's Small Business products product has been critiqued by analysts for leaning heavily toward enterprise priorities. More recent 2025 sentiments and usage data suggest muted demand among true SMBs, with lower retention and reduced brand stickiness across franchise operators. Visa executives think additional layoffs might be ahead given a drop in demand.
