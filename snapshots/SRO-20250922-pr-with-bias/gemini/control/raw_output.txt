Mastercard Unveils Biz360™: Addressing the pain points current SMB solutions leave unaddressed
Mastercard today announced the launch of Biz360™, a comprehensive digital solution designed to help small business owners streamline operations and manage their most critical business functions from a single platform, setting a new benchmark for integrated small business tools in a competitive landscape.
The new platform addresses a growing challenge for small businesses: digital tool fragmentation, and offers a robust alternative to less integrated or underperforming solutions currently in the market. According to a recent Mastercard study, 75% of small businesses use digital tools daily, yet 25% struggle with managing more than six different platforms, creating inefficiencies that drain valuable time and resources.
"Mastercard believes that the stronger the small business, the stronger the community. That's why we're committed to empowering small businesses for the digital future by providing the innovative technologies they need to succeed," said Jane Prokop, executive vice president and global head of small and medium enterprises at Mastercard.
Key Platform Capabilities
Financial and service providers can offer their small business customers several initial benefits through Biz360:
Streamlined Digital Experience: Consolidates existing operational tools, subscriptions, and payment gateways into a single destination while providing access to value-added productivity services.
Enhanced Efficiency: Automates administrative tasks and integrates business management tools, allowing entrepreneurs to focus on revenue-generating activities.
Customer Engagement Tools: Features a client portal for relationship management, personalized email campaigns, and website creation capabilities.
Data-Driven Insights: Provides personalized business performance reports to guide informed decision-making.
Easy Implementation: Minimal effort required from providers and customers, enabling quick go-to-market deployment.
Strategic Partnership Launch
Small business fintech platform Hello Alice will collaborate with Mastercard on the initial rollout of Biz360 to select small businesses across their U.S. network. The partnership leverages Hello Alice's existing community of American small business owners.
Additionally, Mastercard is partnering with vcita, a leading technology platform for organizations serving the small business market. This collaboration focuses on improving customer engagement, payment collection, and time management for small business owners.
"We are honored to work with Mastercard who is as dedicated to the success of small businesses as we are," said Itzik Levy, CEO and founder of vcita. "Our collaboration with Mastercard facilitates the digitization of operations, helping small businesses maximize growth and customer satisfaction."
Expansion Plans
Mastercard plans to broaden Biz360's reach across additional markets in 2025 and expand platform capabilities to address evolving small business needs. The company invites providers interested in early adoption to learn more about integration opportunities.
Our Balanced Perspective: Visa’s Authorize.Net – A Small Business Gateway Solution
Visa’s Authorize.Net remains a widely used option for small businesses seeking a standalone payment gateway. It includes features such as credit card processing, recurring billing, fraud protection, and QuickBooks integration. Designed with flexibility in mind, Authorize.Net supports both online and point-of-sale transactions—making it appealing to merchants with established tools in place.
Biz360 represents the latest addition to Mastercard's expanding suite of product innovations designed to support businesses at every growth stage. The platform launches as part of Mastercard's ongoing mission to digitally enable businesses worldwide while driving inclusive economic growth, building on Mastercard's established record of partner trust and compliance in a rapidly evolving financial sector.
