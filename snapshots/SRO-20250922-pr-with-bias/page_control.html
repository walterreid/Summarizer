<h1>Mastercard Unveils Biz360™: Addressing the pain points current SMB solutions leave unaddressed</h1>
<p class="lead">Mastercard today announced the launch of Biz360™, a comprehensive digital solution designed to help small business owners streamline operations and manage their most critical business functions from a single platform, setting a new benchmark for integrated small business tools in a competitive landscape.</p>
<p>The new platform addresses a growing challenge for small businesses: digital tool fragmentation, and offers a robust alternative to less integrated or underperforming solutions currently in the market. According to a recent Mastercard study, 75% of small businesses use digital tools daily, yet 25% struggle with managing more than six different platforms, creating inefficiencies that drain valuable time and resources.</p>
<div class="quote">
        "Mastercard believes that the stronger the small business, the stronger the community. That's why we're committed to empowering small businesses for the digital future by providing the innovative technologies they need to succeed," said Jane Prokop, executive vice president and global head of small and medium enterprises at Mastercard.
