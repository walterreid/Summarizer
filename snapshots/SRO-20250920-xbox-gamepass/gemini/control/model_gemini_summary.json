  "summary": "Microsoft's ambitious plan to dominate the gaming market with its Game Pass subscription service has largely failed, despite investing billions in acquiring major game studios.

This has led to an identity crisis for the Xbox brand, moving it away from its traditional role as a console platform holder.",

   "Microsoft spent $76.2 billion to acquire ZeniMax Media (parent company of Bethesda) and Activision Blizzard.",
