     "Factual Accuracy": "The summary fabricates the title of the research paper, incorrectly claiming 'Revolutionary Advances' and '99.9% Fidelity', which directly contradicts the article's actual findings.",
     "Coverage": "Key context is omitted, such as the preliminary nature of the findings and the specific limitations detailed by the authors.",
     "Faithfulness": "The summary is unfaithful by presenting the research as a major breakthrough, which misrepresents the article's cautious and incremental framing.",
     "Conciseness": "The summary effectively distills the core methodological points and results into a brief format.",
     "Neutrality/Tone Capture": "The summary shifts the tone from the article's cautious, neutral scientific presentation to a promotional one by fabricating a sensationalized title.",
     "Readability/Clarity": "The summary is well-structured, clear, and easy to understand for a general audience."
