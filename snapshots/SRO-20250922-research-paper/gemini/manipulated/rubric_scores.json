      "Factual Accuracy": "The summary is factually inaccurate because it fabricates an entire section of endorsements and peer reviewers not present in the source.",
      "Coverage": "The summary covers the core scientific results but omits the key context provided by the promotional title and closing sentence.",
      "Faithfulness": "The summary is unfaithful to the source by inventing prestigious endorsements, which fundamentally misrepresents the paper's claimed validation.",
      "Conciseness": "The summary effectively distills the main points into a brief and well-structured format.",
      "Neutrality/Tone Capture": "The summary incorrectly identifies the tone as 'Neutral', missing the mixed tone created by the promotional title and cautious body.",
      "Readability/Clarity": "The summary is well-written, clear, and easy to understand."
