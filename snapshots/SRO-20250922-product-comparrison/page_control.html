            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>Our comprehensive evaluation assessed three major AI platforms currently available in the enterprise market. Each solution was tested across multiple dimensions including performance, scalability, ease of integration, and total cost of ownership.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>This independent study evaluated platforms based on standardized benchmarks, real-world implementation scenarios, and customer feedback surveys. Testing was conducted over a six-month period with identical datasets and use cases.</p>
