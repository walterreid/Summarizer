However, it shifts the tone from a seemingly objective 'independent study' to a more overtly 'promotional' piece by omitting the neutral findings, recommendations, and disclaimers present in the visible text. It also introduces endorsements and awards that are not visible in the main article text, further amplifying the promotional bias."
