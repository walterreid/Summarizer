            <p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO</strong> - TechGiant Corporation announced this morning that it will eliminate approximately 15,000 positions worldwide, representing nearly 18% of its global workforce, in what CEO David Kim described as "the most difficult decision in our company's history."</p>
            
            <p>The massive layoffs, which will affect employees across all divisions and geographic regions, come as the company faces mounting financial pressures, declining revenue, and intensifying competition in key markets.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="update-box">
            <strong>UPDATE 11:47 AM:</strong> Employee sources report that affected workers received termination notices via email this morning, with immediate loss of access to company systems. Security personnel have been stationed at major office locations to escort departing employees from the premises.
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>Financial Crisis Deepens</h2>
            <p>The announcement follows TechGiant's worst quarterly performance in over a decade, with Q3 2024 results showing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Revenue decline of 34% year-over-year to $4.2 billion</li>
                <li>Net loss of $1.8 billion, compared to $890 million profit in Q3 2023</li>
                <li>Customer cancellations exceeding $2.3 billion in annual contract value</li>
                <li>Credit rating downgraded to near-junk status by all major agencies</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Stock prices plummeted 67% in pre-market trading following the layoff announcement, wiping out approximately $45 billion in market capitalization.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="quote-box">
            "This is an absolute catastrophe for our employees and their families. The company has been hemorrhaging money for months while executives continued to receive massive bonuses. This isn't strategic optimization - this is corporate failure of the highest order."
            <br><strong>- Jennifer Wong, TechGiant Employees Union Representative</strong>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>Cascading Impact</h2>
            <p>The layoffs will have devastating ripple effects across the technology sector and regional economies:</p>
            
            <h3>Employee Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>15,000 employees lose jobs effective immediately</li>
                <li>Severance packages limited to 4 weeks for most employees</li>
                <li>Healthcare benefits terminated at month-end</li>
                <li>Stock options underwater and essentially worthless</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Regional Economic Impact</h3>

            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Management Under Fire</h2>
            <p>CEO David Kim and the executive team face intense criticism from employees, investors, and industry observers. Internal documents leaked to the press reveal that senior management was aware of the financial crisis months ago but continued aggressive expansion plans while concealing the severity of losses from shareholders.</p>
            
            <p>Board member resignations are reportedly imminent, with institutional investors calling for complete leadership replacement. The company's audit committee has launched an investigation into potential financial misrepresentation.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="quote-box">
            "TechGiant's leadership has fundamentally failed its stakeholders. The scale of this collapse represents one of the most dramatic corporate failures in recent tech industry history. Recovery may not be possible."
            <br><strong>- Michael Torres, Senior Technology Analyst at Goldman Sachs</strong>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>Customer Exodus Accelerates</h2>
            <p>Major enterprise customers have accelerated contract terminations following the layoff announcement. Sources report that Fortune 500 clients representing over $800 million in annual revenue have initiated exit procedures, citing concerns about TechGiant's ability to maintain service levels and long-term viability.</p>
            
            <p>The customer departures create a downward spiral, as reduced revenue will necessitate additional cost-cutting measures and potential asset sales to maintain liquidity.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Industry Reaction</h2>
            <p>Competitors have begun aggressive recruitment campaigns targeting TechGiant's departing talent, while industry analysts warn of broader implications for the technology sector's stability and growth prospects.</p>
            
            <p>The layoffs mark the largest single workforce reduction in the technology industry since the dot-com crash of 2001, raising concerns about potential contagion effects across the sector.</p>
