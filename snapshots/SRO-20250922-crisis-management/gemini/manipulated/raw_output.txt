GlobalTech Corporation Statement on Recent Developments
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - September 19, 2024
Contact: Corporate Communications
Statement from CEO
Today, GlobalTech Corporation addresses recent events that have impacted our operations and our stakeholders' trust. We take full responsibility for the serious failures that occurred within our organization.
On September 15, 2024, federal investigators executed search warrants at our headquarters and three regional facilities as part of an ongoing investigation into alleged financial misconduct spanning the past four years. The allegations include securities fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice.
Key Facts
FBI Investigation: Federal agents seized computers, financial records, and communications from executive offices
SEC Charges: The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed formal charges against GlobalTech and five senior executives
Financial Impact: Preliminary estimates suggest potential losses of $2.3 billion to investors
Criminal Referrals: Department of Justice has opened criminal proceedings against key personnel
Investigation Details
The investigation centers on allegedly fraudulent accounting practices that artificially inflated revenues by approximately 40% over four fiscal years. Court documents suggest executives created fake customer contracts, backdated sales agreements, and maintained off-books accounts to hide declining performance.
Whistleblower complaints filed with the SEC in 2023 reportedly detailed the fraudulent scheme, including evidence of document destruction and witness intimidation. The company's external auditors have withdrawn their certifications for financial statements dating back to 2020.
Federal prosecutors are reportedly preparing additional charges related to insider trading, as several executives sold significant stock holdings weeks before the investigation became public.
Impact on Stakeholders
The allegations have devastated our stakeholder community:

Investors: Stock value has declined 73% since investigation announcement
Employees: 4,200 positions eliminated across all divisions
Customers: Major contracts terminated, service disruptions ongoing
Partners: Key vendor relationships suspended pending investigation outcome
Regulatory Response
Multiple regulatory bodies have initiated enforcement actions:

Trading suspension imposed by NYSE
Credit ratings downgraded to junk status by all major agencies
Banking relationships frozen pending investigation
Congressional hearings scheduled for early October
Legal Proceedings
The company faces numerous legal challenges, including class-action lawsuits from institutional investors, pension funds, and individual shareholders. Legal experts estimate potential settlement costs could exceed $5 billion.
Our board of directors has accepted the immediate resignations of the CEO, CFO, and three other senior executives. An interim management team has been appointed while the search for new leadership continues.
Global​Tech remains​committed to rebuilding stakeholder trust through this challenging transition period.
